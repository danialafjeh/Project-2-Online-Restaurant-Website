🎨 Frontend Details

🎭 HTML / CSS / JavaScript Frontend
The frontend is built with simple and clean web technologies.

🧱 Bootstrap Template (Templatemo)
Because my specialization is backend development, the UI is based on a Bootstrap template from templatemo.com to achieve a neat, responsive design.

💻 All Backend Logic Implemented by Me
Only the design template is external — every backend feature, logic, and behavior is fully coded by myself.

* NOTE : The language of the website is completely in Persian.
